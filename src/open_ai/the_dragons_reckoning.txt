The Dragon's Reckoning
The morning mist clung to the valleys of Aldermoor like a shroud, thick and cold, as King Aldric rode through the gates of his besieged capital. Behind him, the city of Thornhaven smoldered, its eastern towers reduced to blackened stumps by dragonfire. The great wyrm Vex'athor had descended upon the kingdom three times in as many weeks, and each attack grew bolder, more devastating. The dragon's scales, black as obsidian and shot through with veins of molten gold, had been glimpsed by dozens of survivors. Its roar, they said, could shatter stone and curdle blood.
Aldric was not a young king. Forty winters had weathered his face, carved lines around his eyes, and salted his beard with gray. But his shoulders remained broad, his sword arm strong, and his resolve unshakeable. He had inherited a kingdom at peace and had maintained that peace through wisdom and careful diplomacy. Now, as he stood in the throne room surrounded by his frightened council, he understood that wisdom alone would not save his people.
"Your Majesty," Lord Fenwick pleaded, his voice cracking with desperation, "we must evacuate the northern provinces. The dragon will return. It always returns."
"And where would they go?" Aldric's voice was calm, measured. "How far can a farmer's family travel before the beast catches them in open country? No. We end this here."
The council chamber fell silent. Chancellor Meredith, a woman whose strategic mind had guided three monarchs, leaned forward. "You mean to face it yourself."
It was not a question, and Aldric did not treat it as one. "The old texts speak of Vex'athor. It is no mindless beast. It is ancient, calculating, and it will not stop until it has claimed what it believes it is owed."
"And what is that?" asked Sir Gareth, commander of the royal guard.
"My kingdom. My crown. My life." Aldric stood, his hand resting on the pommel of Dawnbreaker, his ancestral sword. "Three hundred years ago, my ancestor King Aldric the First drove the dragons from these lands. Vex'athor was young then, but it remembers. It seeks vengeance for that ancient defeat."
The preparation took two days. Aldric refused the heavy plate armor his armorer recommended. Against dragonfire, steel would become an oven, cooking him alive inside his own protection. Instead, he chose lighter chainmail beneath thick leather treated with alchemical fire-retardant salves. The royal smiths worked through the night to forge him a new shield, one faced with polished silver that might reflect the dragon's flames. His sword, Dawnbreaker, was honed until its edge could split a falling hair.
On the morning of the third day, Aldric rode alone to the Dragon's Gate, a mountain pass where the valley narrowed between two towering cliffs. It was here, according to the ancient chronicles, that his ancestor had made his stand. The ground was still scorched from Vex'athor's most recent passage. The air tasted of sulfur and ash.
Aldric dismounted and sent his horse back toward the city. What came next was between him and the dragon alone. He walked to the center of the pass and drove Dawnbreaker point-first into the rocky ground. Then he waited.
The dragon came with the sunset, its shadow falling across the valley like the hand of death itself. Vex'athor was massive beyond mortal reckoning, its wingspan broad enough to eclipse the dying sun. When it landed, the earth trembled, and rocks tumbled from the cliffsides. Its eyes, like molten gold, fixed upon the small figure standing before it.
"KING OF ASHES," the dragon's voice rumbled, each word resonating in Aldric's chest like a second heartbeat. Dragons spoke rarely to humans, but when they did, their words carried the weight of centuries. "YOU HAVE COME TO BEG FOR YOUR KINGDOM'S LIFE."
"I have come to end this," Aldric called back, his voice steady despite the primal terror that screamed at him to flee. "You claim my ancestor wronged you. Face me now, and let our combat settle the debt."
The dragon's laugh was like an avalanche, terrible and beautiful. "YOUR ANCESTOR WAS A COWARD WHO USED TREACHERY AND MAGIC. HE POISONED THE EARTH ITSELF TO DRIVE US OUT. AND NOW YOU, HIS WEAK DESCENDANT, STAND BEFORE ME WITH A NEEDLE AND CALL IT JUSTICE?"
"I stand before you with honor," Aldric replied. "Something you would not recognize."
Vex'athor's eyes narrowed. The dragon's pride was legendary, and Aldric had studied the old texts carefully. He knew that dragons, for all their terrible power, were creatures of ritual and code. An insult to their honor could not go unanswered.
"VERY WELL, LITTLE KING. I WILL GRANT YOU YOUR WISH FOR COMBAT. AND WHEN I HAVE TORN THE FLESH FROM YOUR BONES, I WILL MOUNT YOUR CROWN UPON MY HOARD AS A TROPHY."
The dragon reared back, its chest swelling with gathering fire. Aldric snatched Dawnbreaker from the ground and raised his silver shield. The world became flame. A torrent of dragonfire, white-hot and howling, engulfed the space where he stood. Aldric crouched behind his shield, feeling the terrible heat wash over him, around him. The silver surface glowed red, then white, but held. The treated leather of his armor smoked but did not catch fire.
When the flames subsided, Aldric was still standing, though his shield was warped and his arm trembled from the effort of holding it. Vex'athor's eyes widened fractionally—surprise, perhaps, or the first hint of respect.
The king did not wait for a second blast. He charged forward, Dawnbreaker held high, and Vex'athor, shocked by the audacity of this tiny creature's assault, reared back. Aldric was not foolish enough to think he could match the dragon's strength. Instead, he relied on speed and the terrain. He rolled beneath the dragon's snapping jaws and struck upward, Dawnbreaker's enchanted blade biting into the softer scales beneath Vex'athor's throat.
The dragon roared in pain and fury, rearing back and swiping with claws the size of scythes. Aldric barely escaped, throwing himself aside as those terrible talons gouged deep furrows in the stone where he had stood. He scrambled up one of the fallen boulders, using the uneven terrain to his advantage, making himself a difficult target.
Vex'athor's tail whipped around like a battering ram. Aldric saw it coming and jumped, but not quite far enough. The tail caught his legs, sending him spinning through the air. He crashed against the cliff wall, the impact driving the air from his lungs. Blood filled his mouth. Something was broken—ribs, perhaps several.
But Aldric forced himself to his feet. Through the haze of pain, he watched Vex'athor circle, the dragon's movements now more cautious. The wound beneath its throat bled black ichor. It was not a mortal wound, but it was a wound nonetheless. The dragon had learned that this king had teeth.
"YOU FIGHT WELL, FOR A HUMAN," Vex'athor admitted, landing before him once more. "BUT YOU ARE BROKEN. YIELD NOW, AND I WILL MAKE YOUR DEATH SWIFT."
Aldric spat blood and shook his head. "I don't need to defeat you, dragon. I only need to prove that you cannot defeat me without cost. How many more wounds can you take? How many more kings will rise after me? My kingdom will never stop fighting. Never."
The dragon's eyes blazed. "THEN YOU WILL DIE DEFIANT BUT DEAD NONETHELESS."
Vex'athor lunged, jaws wide enough to swallow a horse. But Aldric had been waiting for this, had been maneuvering toward this moment. As the dragon committed to its attack, Aldric threw himself forward rather than away, sliding beneath those terrible jaws. Dawnbreaker flashed upward in a two-handed grip, and the blade—forged with ancient magic specifically to pierce dragon hide—plunged deep into the soft palate of Vex'athor's mouth, driving up toward the brain.
The dragon's scream shook the very mountains. Vex'athor thrashed wildly, its tail and wings battering the cliffs, bringing down avalanches of stone. Aldric held on to Dawnbreaker's grip with desperate strength, even as the dragon's convulsions threw him about like a rag doll. His broken ribs ground against each other, sending white-hot spears of agony through his body, but he did not let go. He could not let go.
Finally, with a last shuddering exhalation that smelled of sulfur and ancient malice, Vex'athor collapsed. The great dragon's eyes dimmed, the golden fire within them guttering like dying embers. Aldric was pinned beneath the dragon's jaw, unable to move. He could feel his consciousness slipping, darkness creeping in at the edges of his vision.
When the royal guard found him three hours later, they thought him dead. Sir Gareth himself lifted the king from beneath the dragon's corpse, and the old knight wept openly to find his sovereign still breathing, still alive. The sword Dawnbreaker remained buried in the dragon's skull, a testament to the king's victory.
The recovery was long and painful. Aldric spent six weeks in the palace infirmary, healers and physicians working tirelessly to mend his broken body. Four ribs had been shattered, his left arm fractured, and he had suffered a concussion that left him with blinding headaches for months afterward. But he lived, and more importantly, his kingdom lived.
News of the king's victory spread quickly. The dragon Vex'athor, terror of the northern kingdoms for three centuries, was dead. King Aldric had faced the ancient wyrm in single combat and emerged victorious. Songs were written, ballads sung in every tavern from Thornhaven to the distant southern seas. Children played at being the Dragon King in the streets, while bards embellished the tale with each retelling until it seemed Aldric had fought a dozen dragons rather than one.
But Aldric himself spoke little of that day. When pressed by his courtiers or visiting dignitaries, he would only say, "I did what any king must do. I protected my people."
In truth, the experience had changed him. He had looked into the eyes of an ancient, intelligent being and seen the weight of centuries of hatred and pain. Vex'athor had not been evil, merely unforgiving. The dragon had sought what it believed was justice for ancient wrongs. That both could not survive was simply the tragedy of their positions, not a triumph of good over evil.
The dragon's body became a source of great wealth for the kingdom. Its scales were harvested and fashioned into armor for the royal guard, each piece inscribed with wards of protection. Its bones were carved into tools and weapons of surpassing quality. Its heart, still warm days after death, was preserved by the court alchemists and placed in the royal vault. Some said it still beat, slowly, once every hour, a reminder of the price of victory.
King Aldric ruled for another twenty years after his battle with Vex'athor. He never married, never produced an heir, and when asked why, he would gaze toward the northern mountains where the Dragon's Gate stood and say nothing. Some whispered that part of him had died with the dragon that day, that he had given not just his blood but something deeper, more essential, to purchase his kingdom's safety.
When death finally came for King Aldric, it was quietly, in his sleep, surrounded by his council and the few companions who had stood by him through the dragon years. His final words were recorded by Chancellor Meredith, who had served him faithfully until the end: "Tell them the dragon was magnificent. Tell them it deserved better than me."
They buried him in the royal crypt beneath the cathedral, and on his tomb they inscribed simply: "King Aldric, who fought so his people would not have to." And there, standing guard over his sarcophagus, they placed the sword Dawnbreaker, the blade that had slain a dragon and saved a kingdom, forever testament to the day a king proved himself worthy of his crown.
